        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Welcome to my personal reflection page. Here I share my journey, aspirations, and thoughts as I progress through this program.</p>

            <h2>Bio</h2>
            <p>
                I'm Habeeb Lateef, a passionate developer and tech enthusiast who believes in the power of continuous learning. 
                My journey in technology started with curiosity about how websites work, and it has evolved into a deep passion 
                for creating meaningful digital experiences. I enjoy cooking and cleaning in my spare time, as they help me 
                maintain a balanced lifestyle and clear mind for coding challenges.
            </p>
            <p>
                I believe that technology should serve humanity and make life better for everyone. This philosophy drives 
                my approach to development, where I focus on creating accessible, user-friendly solutions that solve real problems.

            <h2>Areas of Low Confidence</h2>
            <p>Honesty about my current limitations helps me focus my learning efforts:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Advanced JavaScript Concepts:</strong> Closures, prototypes, and asynchronous programming patterns still challenge me</li>
                <li><strong>CSS Grid and Flexbox:</strong> While I understand the basics, complex layouts sometimes require trial and error</li>
                <li><strong>Testing:</strong> Unit testing and integration testing are areas I need to develop further</li>
                <li><strong>Performance Optimization:</strong> Understanding how to write efficient code and optimize for speed</li>
                <li><strong>Backend Integration:</strong> Working with APIs and understanding how frontend connects to backend services</li>
                <li><strong>State Management:</strong> Complex state management patterns in larger applications</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                I view these challenges as opportunities for growth rather than obstacles. Each area represents 
                a chance to expand my skills and become a more well-rounded developer.

            <h2>Note to Future Self</h2>
            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    Dear Future Me,
                </p>
                <p>
                    Remember this moment - the excitement, the uncertainty, and the determination you feel right now. 
                    You're starting this journey with curiosity and passion, and these qualities will serve you well. 
                    Don't be afraid to make mistakes; they are your greatest teachers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When you encounter challenges (and you will), remember that every expert was once a beginner. 
                    Stay humble, keep learning, and always be willing to help others who are where you are today. 
                    The community you build along the way will be just as valuable as the skills you develop.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Most importantly, never lose sight of why you started this journey. Technology is a tool for 
                    creating positive change in the world. Use your skills wisely and always code with empathy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Keep pushing forward, stay curious, and remember to celebrate your progress along the way.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With hope and determination,<br>
                    Your Past Self
                </p>

            <h2>Extra Thoughts</h2>
            <h3>On Learning</h3>
            <p>
                Learning to code is like learning a new language - it requires patience, practice, and persistence. 
                I've discovered that the best way to learn is by building projects that interest me and solving 
                problems that matter.
            </p>
            
            <h3>On Community</h3>
            <p>
                The developer community is incredibly welcoming and supportive. I'm grateful for the open-source 
                culture that allows us to learn from each other's code and contribute to projects that benefit everyone.
            </p>
            
            <h3>On the Future</h3>
            <p>
                I'm excited about the future of web development. Technologies like WebAssembly, Progressive Web Apps, 
                and AI integration are opening up new possibilities. I want to be part of building the next generation 
                of web experiences.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Personal Motivation</h3>
            <p>
                What drives me most is the ability to create something from nothing - to turn an idea into a 
                functional, beautiful application that people can use and enjoy. There's something magical about 
                writing code that solves real problems and makes life a little bit easier for someone else.
